### Section 1: Introduction to Robotics
__1.1 What is FIRST?__

FIRST was started in 1989 by inventor Dean Kamen. The FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) programs aim to create passion for science and technology in students. The FIRST program encourages Gracious Professionalism and Co-Opertition, sportsmanship amongst teams even in the face of competition. Through FIRST, students build technical skills, and foster teamwork and leadership skills.
